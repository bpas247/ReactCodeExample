# React Code Example

This project is an example web application that makes use of different React componants and related tools.

## Getting Started

This is a very simple web application so there isn't much you will need to get it running. It is self contained and doesn't require the use of any external APIs or services.

## High Level Pieces

Here is a short list of key components used in the example. These will serve as stepping stone to a deeper dive in the future.

* React (16)
* React Router (4)
* Redux
* ES6
* Tests using Jest

## What's not included

Here is a short list of major concepts not included in this example.

* Middleware
* Server side validation
* GraphQL integration

## Running the tests

Testing is managed with Jest/Enzyme. To run a test suite, use the following command
```
yarn run test
```

## Deployment

For DEV Deployment
```
yarn run start
```

For PROD Deployment
```
yarn run build
```

## Built With

* [React](https://reactjs.org/) - Web Framework
